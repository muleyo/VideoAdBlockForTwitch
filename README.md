# VideoAdBlockForTwitch
This video adblock for Twitch extension will swap Twitch video ads for an ad-free version of the stream at 480p and then automatically switch back to the original video quality once the ad is finished. This is all done locally, no proxies, no VPN's and no third party websites. The extension does not collect nor share any personal information and is opensource, link is below. Works best when used with UBlock Origin, although this extension does also block some ad tracking URL's.

# Info

The original author decided to be a bitch by adding his amazon ref-link to his chrome extension. I've removed that part entirely.

# Installation Steps

- [Download the latest .ZIP Archive](https://github.com/cleanlock/VideoAdBlockForTwitch/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- Extract the ZIP Archive
- Open up Chrome and in your Web Browser URL, enter: `chrome://extensions`
- Enable the `Developer Mode` toggle, found in the top right of this view (typically) of the extensions page in your browser.
- Click `Load unpacked Extension`
- Navigate to the extracted folder from the ZIP Archive and select that folder.

# Objective of this fork

- Keeping it donation- and ref-link free and ofcourse ___always open source___
- Migrating to Manifest v3 (Chrome)
- Publishing to the Chrome Webstore
