# Twitch Adblock
Twitch Adblock blocks ads on Twitch by switching to an ad-free version of the stream at 480p during the ad-time and automatically switches back to the original video quality after the ad-time is over. This is 100% done locally, no proxies/VPNs or 3rd party scripts/websites are being used. This extension does not collect/share any of your personal information and the code is public. 

It is recommended to use this extension along with UBlock Origin.

Sourcecode: https://github.com/cleanlock/VideoAdBlockForTwitch

The original author of this extension is "saucettv". This extension will always stay donation- and refferal-link free.

# Info

The original author decided to be a bitch by adding his amazon ref-link to his chrome extension. I've removed that part entirely.

# Installation Steps

- [Download the latest .ZIP Archive](https://github.com/cleanlock/VideoAdBlockForTwitch/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- Extract the ZIP Archive
- Open up Chrome and in your Web Browser URL, enter: `chrome://extensions`
- Enable the `Developer Mode` toggle, found in the top right of this view (typically) of the extensions page in your browser.
- Click `Load unpacked Extension`
- Navigate to the extracted folder from the ZIP Archive and select that folder.

# Objective of this fork

- Keeping it donation- and ref-link free and ofcourse ___always open source___
- Migrating to Manifest v3 (Chrome)
- Publishing to the Chrome Webstore
